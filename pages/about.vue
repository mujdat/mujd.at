        I was born in Bulgaria, grew up in Turkey and I've been living in
        Germany since 2011. I was introduced to the world of web development
        back in high school and my first site was built with WordPress!
      </p>
      <p>
        For a long time I did web development as a hobby and it was a lot of
        fun! I then started to study Linguistics at TU Dresden but after a
        couple years into my studies I decided to drop out and pursue a career
        as a web developer. During my studies and the transitional period to
        becoming a developer I had worked in different fields such as
        communication, customer service and retail but finally in May 2020, I
        found my dream job as a Front-End Developer at PHMU!
